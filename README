CONTRIBUTIONS
In this project, our team implemented a Hero vs. Minotaur maze game.
Alex Zhang implemented entity.cpp, basicgamerules.cpp, game.cpp, maze.cpp, and corresponding header files;
Wenxuan Lu implemented derived classes of Tile and EntityController (inanimate.cpp, chasehero.cpp, astarchasehero.cpp, uicontrol.cpp), and also textui.cpp.
Yuntao Li implemented the driver program and cursesui.cpp. He had some emergency in the first two weeks, but he kept up with us as much as possible and really contributed a lot in the debugging and revising process.
Each of us read through other's code and engaged in the whole debugging process.
